# How to install content

Content is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete /content folder into the /modules directory of your website. 

Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the content icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. 

Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.
